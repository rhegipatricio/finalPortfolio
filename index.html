								<h1>Greetings and salutations.</h1>
								<h1>I am <strong>Rheginald Patricio</strong></h1>
								<h1>Welcome to my Portfolio!</h1>
								<p> 	I am a consistent thinker and creator who has now found my way to being a full stack web developer, where I can continue the journey of developing and making unique creations not only in the world of tech, but things that can be shared and enjoyed by the world in many avenues. </p>
								<br>
								<p>		Bringing it back, I’d like to think the term “Developer” has always been a constant theme in my life, developing various things such as when I was a kid when I developed little creative projects such as an imaginary talk show on a tape recorder. Later in life, I’d develop and create creative short story narratives for people to read and enjoy.</p>
								<br>
								<p>		So naturally progressing, I found that tech is a whole new bag of worms where I can combine my ideas and creative writing with the unlimited potential of the technical industry. As a developer, I see myself more on the creative and designing side which would entail the front end, but who is also able to contribute to the backend. I strive to continue to learn so I can fully immerse myself in the tech industry, but in a creative way such as using tech as a way to funnel my creative interests to make a mark in the world and to make people happy. I believe I can use tech with entertainment to create amazing things, hopefully in the entertainment and film industry, but anywhere else as well. I always thought that tech itself it was a forever expanding industry where one can continue to learn new things and grow with it so I wanted to see if I could be a part of something so expanding. I definitely feel as a growing developer, I had a good understanding of something like MySQL and how to make databases. Databases are full of information and knowledge and knowledge is powerful. When we were first introduced to it, I was able to understand the concept that it was basically a filter that helped you find whatever select data you wanted to. Any information was at your fingertips. You only needed to know the syntax of trying to find the data that you want to have. In the learning process, I believe some transferrable skills that have and will continue to help me are working within a team as well as maintaining calmness under pressure. Life itself is unpredictable and you might find yourself having to adapt at any given moment of time. Speaking of time, every single person on Earth has twenty four hours in a day. It’s what you do with those hours that are important. Having open communication with others is always important. If there is a group project to be done, people need to know their roles so that the overall group may be successful so they should keep an open dialogue. Dialogue goes back to writing. It’s all full circle and there’s unlimited potential to create amazing things.</p>
